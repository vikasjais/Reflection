There are two ways to generate pascal's triangle.
(a) Using Dynamic Programming.
(b) Using recursive method.

If we need single binomial coefficient go for recursive approach.
If we need more than one binomial coefficient go for DP approach.

There is a method to generate nth row of pascals's triangle.
