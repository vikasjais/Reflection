Common Query Optimization Techniques.

Look-up Table:
•	Look-up Table is an array (1D or 2D) that replaces runtime computation with a simpler array indexing
•	operation.
•	It is required when there is necessity of performing frequent computation on some array elements.
•	In look-up table we precompute the required computation and stored into 2D or 1D matrix ( based on requirement) and we access the result whenever it's required.
•	Time complexity to generate look-up table is  O(n^2).
•	Space Complexity is O(n^2).
•	Time complexity to access the computed result is constant i.e O(1).
    
Square Root Decomposition Technique:
•	Sqrt Decomposition is a method (or a data structure) that allows you to perform some common operations (finding sum of the elements of the sub-array, finding the minimal/maximal element, etc.) in O(sqrt(n)) operations, which is much faster than O(n) for the trivial algorithm.
•	Time complexity to make O(n).
•	Space Complexity is O(sqrt(n)).
•	Time Complexity to query is O(sqrt(n)).
